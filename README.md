<li>I believe in <b>creating opportunities</b> instead of waiting for them. I like to learn new technologies so that I can use them while <b>solving the problems</b>. I follow the <b>'Learn-Share-Learn'</b> approach to improve my skills. I haven't created any community but I am part of many of them.</li>

Nowadays I am learning <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Golang</b> which is very interesting and challenging for me.</li>
